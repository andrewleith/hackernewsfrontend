# Project Purpose
My goal was to see if I could create a fipboard-like UI in a web application. This is not intended to be a fully functional news reader. I added loading of the stories to make it sort of complete, but they are just loaded via an iframe and it doesn't seem to work properly for all sites.  

# Animation
I used the greensock libraries for the flip animation as well as handling of swipe detection.  They are an extremely powerful set of tools for javascript-based animation.
